HistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHistoryHi

Zeno is based in part on the Nemo Stellar Dynamics Toolbox, initially
developed by myself, Piet Hut, and Peter Teuben in the late 1980s at
the Institute for Advanced Study.  I began work on Zeno in 1989 at the
Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics; my initial reason for
creating a separate package was to try out a different way of storing
particle data (now implemented as a phatstruct).  Zeno and Nemo have
many design features and strategies in common; however, Zeno is more
compact (~125 files of source code, as compared to ~4000), and as the
product of a single individual it is probably more coherent and
internally consistent.
